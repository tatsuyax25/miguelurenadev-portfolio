      <p className="mt-4">
        As a devoted and driven Software Engineer, I specialize in developing
        innovative and efficient software solutions that drive business success.
        With a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end development, I
        excel in crafting scalable applications using the MERN stack (MongoDB,
        Express, React, Node.js) and other cutting-edge technologies.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4">
        My journey in technology has been marked by a commitment to continuous
        learning and a dedication to excellence. From my early days providing
        technical support and managing e-commerce platforms to my current focus
        on full-stack development, I have always prioritized user experience,
        clean code, and impactful results.
