Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for checking out my personal portfolio website. This project is a representation of my skills, creativity, and passion for software development. Built with **Next.js**, **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **MongoDB**, this portfolio is more than just a showcaseâ€”it's a demonstration of my work, my journey, and how I approach development challenges.

Feel free to explore the website, and if you're interested in getting in touch, there's an easy-to-use contact form powered by MongoDB and integrated with Google Analytics to help me better understand how visitors engage with the site.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

- **Personal Showcase**: Get a glimpse into who I am, my skill set, and the exciting projects Iâ€™ve worked on.

- **Responsive Design**: Whether you're on a mobile device, tablet, or desktop, the layout adjusts seamlessly.
- **Contact Form**: Reach out with ease through the integrated contact form, where submissions go directly to my email. Powered by MongoDB, it's the perfect way to connect with me.
- **Social Media Links**: Find me on LinkedIn and GitHubâ€”let's connect and collaborate!
- **Google Analytics**: For better insights into how users engage with my site, tracking interactions and page views.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies & Tools

This portfolio uses some of the best tools and technologies to ensure an outstanding user experience and performance:

- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Font Awesome, Slick Carousel
- **Backend**: MongoDB for storing contact form submissions
- **Analytics**: Google Analytics to track visitor behavior
- **Deployment**: Hosted on Netlify

## ðŸ“Œ Features Breakdown
1. Contact Form with MongoDB
The contact form allows anyone to easily get in touch with me by submitting their name, email, subject, and message. The data is securely stored in MongoDB and sent to my inbox, ensuring quick communication.

2. Dark Mode Toggle
I believe in giving users control, which is why the portfolio includes a dark mode toggle! Whether you prefer a lighter theme or the sleekness of dark mode, you can easily switch between the two. Plus, your preference is saved, so you donâ€™t have to toggle every time you visit.

3. Google Analytics Integration
Google Analytics is set up to track how users interact with the site. This is especially helpful for understanding user behavior and improving the overall experience. Once you set up your own Google Analytics account, the site will automatically start tracking traffic and engagement metrics.

4. Social Media Links
Iâ€™ve included easy-to-find links to my professional social profiles. Whether you're interested in connecting via LinkedIn or checking out my latest projects on GitHub, itâ€™s all right there!

More projects: I plan to add more detailed project sections to showcase individual pieces of my work.
Blog: A blog section could be a great way to share development insights and tutorials.
