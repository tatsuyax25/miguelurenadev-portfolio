            As a devoted and driven Software Engineer, I specialize in
            developing innovative and efficient software solutions that drive
            business success. With a strong foundation in both front-end and
            back-end development, I excel in crafting scalable applications
            using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and other
            cutting-edge technologies.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            My journey in technology has been marked by a commitment to
            continuous learning and a dedication to excellence. From my early
            days providing technical support and managing e-commerce platforms
            to my current focus on full-stack development, I have always
            prioritized user experience, clean code, and impactful results.
